This website is the archive for the **9th International Woodpecker Conference**, which was held in Puerto Iguazú, Misiones province, Argentina, from August 11 to 14, 2024.

The conference was organized by the Special Interest Group (SIG) Woodpeckers of the German Ornithological Society (DO-G) in cooperation with the Instituto de Biología Subtropical (IBS-UNAM-CONICET). It was the first international woodpecker conference to be held outside of Europe, aiming to address aspects of biology and conservation of woodpeckers and to foster collaboration between South American researchers and the international community.
